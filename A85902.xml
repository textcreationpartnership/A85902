            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>General MONCKS RESOLVTION To make good His DECLARATION VVith the loſs of his Blood. In a Letter from New-Caſtle November twenty nine, 1659. To a Worthy Perſon in London.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOur laſt I received with ſafety, and according to your deſire have ſent you a true Account of the moſt material intelligence touching the preſent tranſactions in theſe Northern parts, <hi>viz.</hi> The General Aſſembly do ſtill continue, and have three conſiderable Caſtles granted them by General <hi>Monck,</hi> to be at their diſpoſing as an aſſurance of his fidelity toward them. And for ought I can perceive, there is very little or no hopes of Agreement, becauſe General <hi>Monck</hi> hath ſet down his Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make good his former Declaration with the loſſe of his Bloud; for he will not agree to any thing againſt what is therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. And as we hear General <hi>Monck</hi> is much offended at the Lord <hi>Lambert,</hi> who hath intercepred his Letters to General <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and opened them, and Letters to his own Commiſſioners.</p>
            <p>Yeſterday came an expreſs from him, and the Meſſenger accidentally having got a fall, could go no further then this place, That the Lord <hi>Lambert</hi> opened the Letters, and ſent them by a Meſſenger of his own to the City of <hi>London.</hi> General <hi>Monck</hi> writes to General <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> that he perceived his Commiſſioners had agreed to ſome things contrary to his Order and Declaration, the which Agreement he would not own; and he therein deſired that 5 Commiſſioners might be ſent to this Town, and that he would add two more to his three to Treat with thoſe five Commiſſioners about an Agreement; But it much diſpleaſed the Lord <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> ſo that he was fully reſolved to march againſt him with as much expedition as poſſible he could, but this day calling a Council of the Officers of his Army, hath a little ſtayed his March. We are much oppreſſed in theſe parts with the continuance of the Arm here, The Lord ſupport us, and carry on all for his Glory, for the Good of the Church and People. General <hi>Monck</hi> is a Reſolved General. The Lord ſtand by them that ſtand by his Truth and Goſpel. One of the Letters ſent by General <hi>Monck</hi> to the Lord <hi>Fleetwood</hi> was as followeth, <hi>viz. My Lord,</hi> I have received a Letter from your Lordſhip, and by the ſame Pacquet an Agreement, ſigned by your Lordſhips hand, together with an intimation, that the ſame was ſigned by thoſe Gentlemen that were appointed by the General council of Officers here, to treat with your Lordſhip. I am exceedingly rejoyced to find in your Lordſhip, and the Officers with you, a ſpirit ſo complying, and ſo tender of the Publick peace, and ſhall upon intimation had from my Lord <hi>Lambert,</hi> of what method he uſeth, in drawing off the Forces which he hath drawn towards us, obſerve the ſame here; but becauſe I am deſirous that this Agreement of yours may be full and firm, and becauſe I perceive that there are ſome things remain here untreated of, and unagreed upon, it is the reſolution of my ſelf and Officers here, to adde two more to their number, that they may confer with the like number of ſuch as ſhall be appointed by your Lordſhip, for the putting a final end to this unhappy buſineſs; onely deſiring, that it may be as ſoon as poſſible; and if your Lordſhip would permit it to be at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> it would very much expedite the buſineſs, of which I ſuppoſe your Lordſhip can be no leſs deſirous than I am, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you cannot but be ſenſible, that the whole three Nations are in expectation of this iſſue; till which, all publick buſines muſt needs be at a ſtand, unleſs it be that of the publick enemy, who cannot but apprehend his own advantages, and will very boldly let them ſlip. <hi>My Lord,</hi> As in this time of our greateſt miſunderſtandings and miſapprehenſions, there is nothing of perſonal relation to your ſelfe, or any Officer with You; ſo it will be very eaſie to return to that mutual confidence and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which on my part was never loſt; and I can as really and heartily as ever, ſubſribe myſelf,</p>
